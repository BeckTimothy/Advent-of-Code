# Advent of Code

This repository is for the purpose of storing the questions and my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges provided by Eric Wastl at https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is a 25 day coding challenge presenting two challenges a day from December 1st until December 25th, with Christmas themed data mutation and algorithm problems with randomized data sets, solving them will utilize many programming concepts. I plan to utilize these challenges to challenge myself, excersize my development skills, and learn a variety of algorithm and data structure concepts.
