# Advent of Code

This repository is for the purpose of storing the questions and my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges provided by Eric Wastl at https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is a 12 (previously 25) day coding challenge presenting two challenges a day from December 1st until December 12th, with Christmas themed data structs, mutation, and algorithm problems with randomized data sets, solving them will utilize many programming concepts. I plan to utilize these challenges to challenge myself, exercise my development skills, and learn a variety of algorithm and data structure concepts. 

Rather, because it's fun.
